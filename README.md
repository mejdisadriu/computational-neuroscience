# Computational Neuroscience - From Zero

Learning neuroscience by building neural models from scratch in pure Python.

## What's Here

Simple neuron simulations - no complex libraries, just pure Python to understand how neurons work.

**Philosophy:** Build it yourself → understand it deeply.

## Models

### 1. Simple Threshold Neuron
**File:** `threshold_neuron.py`

The absolute basics: voltage rises with input, hits threshold → spike!
```bash
python threshold_neuron.py
```

**What it teaches:** How neurons generate spikes.

### 2. Leaky Neuron *(coming soon)*
Adding realistic voltage decay.

### 3. Synaptic Input *(coming soon)*
How neurons receive signals from other neurons.

## Why Pure Python?

- **No setup hassle** - just run the code
- **See every step** - no "magic" from libraries
- **Learn deeply** - understand what's really happening

Later we'll add NumPy, Brian2, Nest, NEURON etc. But first: fundamentals.


# Clone
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computational-neuroscience.git
cd computational-neuroscience




## Background Needed

- Basic Python (loops, if statements)
- Basic neuroscience (what's a neuron, what's a spike)
